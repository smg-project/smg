//! Tool calls written as tagged parameters.
//!
//! Several model families write a call as a function tag followed by one tag per argument, the
//! value as plain text between the parameter's opening and closing tag: Qwen 3.5 and later and
//! Qwen3-Coder (`<function=name>`, `<parameter=key>`), DeepSeek's DSML, MiniMax, GLM and Hy, each
//! with its own spellings. What they share is that the arguments are built by the parser, not
//! passed through: the model writes no JSON object, so the parser writes one, and it has to decide
//! what type each value's text is.
//!
//! [`value`] is that decision. The assembler that turns a call's text into its events comes next.
