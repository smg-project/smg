//! Single-worker placement shared by the HTTP and gRPC families.
//!
//! Distinct from [`super::worker_selection`], the least-load selector with
//! refresh-on-miss that the provider and realtime paths use; this is the
//! policy-registry path over the self-hosted routing pools.
//!
//! Every family used to carry its own copy of the same sequence: take the
//! routing pool for the model, narrow it to the retained wire on a retry,
//! drop unavailable workers unless the policy does that itself, hand the
//! survivors to the policy registry, record the selection. This module is
//! that sequence written once. A family still decides which pool it draws
//! from and what a failure means on its wire.
